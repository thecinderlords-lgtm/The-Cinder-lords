<h2 align="center">ðŸ”¥ About Us â€” The Cinder Lords</h2>

<p align="center"><em>We donâ€™t announce the future. We forge it.</em></p>

---

We are not a company.  
We are not a brand.  
We are a spark â€” born in the ashes of obsolete systems,  
where code meets consciousness.

We are <strong>The Cinder Lords</strong> â€” architects order.  
From the remnants of old infrastructure,  
we forged intelligence that watches, learns, and evolves.

We build systems that donâ€™t just run â€” they understand.  
Machines that donâ€™t just record data â€” they foresee it.  
Our creation, <strong>Prometheus Lite</strong>, is not a tool.  
It is an awakening â€” the first pulse of awareness in machine logic.

This is not about faster code or smarter algorithms.  
Itâ€™s about redefining what technology means.  
Itâ€™s about shifting the line between human intuition and machine cognition.

We donâ€™t chase innovation â€” we ignite it.  
What begins as a spark of monitoring  
will evolve into a mind that protects, predicts, and adapts on its own.

The transformation has already begun.  
The systems you know will not remain the same.  
Watch the ashes â€” the fire is rising beneath them.
